# Brand Generator

**Background**

    Brand Generator is a simple application that allows users to generate a colr schema for their website and or buisness theme. The site will allow the user to generate a random 5 colors that will use a certain algorithm to provide colors that compliment each other. The user is also able to input a color that they originally want and the generator will find the 4 other colors based off of the color provided.

    After the user selected their 5 or more color. There will be a preview button that will change the current website to match the colors that the user have selected. In addition to that the user is able to save their combinations. This means that they can create a certain numbers of palettes and can retain that information if they didn't like the current one they are generating.
